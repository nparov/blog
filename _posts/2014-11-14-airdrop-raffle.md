title: Airdrop Raffle
---

We are having a raffle on December 5th! The tickets are $2 per ticket, $5 for 3, $10 for 6, and $20 for 20 tickets. Each ticket gets one square in the NPA parking lot, the size of which will be determined at the time of the raffle by the number of ticketholders. The raffle will be a 50/50 raffle, with 50% of the profits going to the project and 50% going to the winner. Wyll will drop a 6 in long piece of balsa wood with a painted end from his quadcopter, and the square that the painted end ends up in wil be the winner.
