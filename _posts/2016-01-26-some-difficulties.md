title: A few minor glitches...
---

As is NPA tradition, the Juniors and Seniors did a play, the Madwoman of Chaillot, earlier this month. Unfortunately for the ROV team, that means that Wyll was unable to help us for two weeks! In addition, Arny was in South Africa on his honeymoon for the first week of school. During that time, the ROV class was trying to figure out a solution to the problem of the large cord not fitting. This cord is the cord that connects the e-chassis to the motors, and the problem is that it would prevent the e-chassis housing from getting fully into its spot, as the cord was in between the e-chassis and the main backbone of the ROV.

Once Wyll came back, the camera was inverted and the e-chassis returned to the proper orientation. Hopefully it will get into the water soon!
