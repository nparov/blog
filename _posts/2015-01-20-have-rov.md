title: We have the ROV!
---

The ROV is here in Arcata, CA, USA! And that means that it is time to thank our contributors:

* Keta Paulson
* Peter Williams
* Marliese Tollner
* GHD (bought Winzler and Kelly)
* GHD Staff
* The Shop (Arcata, CA)
* Parents and Relatives
* Others to be added when the Junior/Senior play is completed

Thanks you to all of our contributors!  

We will put the unpacking ceremony video on YouTube and link to it as soon as it uploads.
The building process will start this week on Friday!
