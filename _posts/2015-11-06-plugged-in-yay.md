title: Finally, the ROV has been turned on!
---

After a long struggle with finding a mini USB A cord, and months of work building it, the ROV is finally (almost) finished. Today, it was plugged in to a computer for the first time! The motors work, but unfortunately the lasers don't, yet. They will be fixed next Tuesday, and the ROV will hopefully get to go in the water soon.
