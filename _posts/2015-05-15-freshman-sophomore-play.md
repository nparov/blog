title: Freshman-Sophomore Play
---

Starting on last monday, all of school for the freshmen and sophomores is being used for the play. That effectively means that there is one more ROV class, as there is a very small chance for ROV to happen on the last day of school.

There were two afterschool ROV sessions last week, where we soldered one thing and unravelled the new tether. This time we were able to complete the task without extreme tangling: we learned our lesson from last time. The motors have been mounted, and although there have not been any photos uploaded to the site (sorry!), we hope to do so soon.

That's about it for now.
