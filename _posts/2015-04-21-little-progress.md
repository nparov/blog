title: Very Little Progress
---

There is good news and bad news.

Good news: Arny is married!

Bad news: There has been very little progress on the ROV in the past few weeks.

Arny is contacting Eric Stackpole from OpenROV to get a new tether, but we as the class have not recieved word what has come of that. 
A little progress has been made on the camera mount/electronics chassis, but not much. 
We finally got the magic lube, from both Xavier and Arny. (Most of) the juniors have been working on lubing the o-rings, and finished that a few weeks ago.

Arny's absence has not been the only holdup to the NPAROV team. There have been multitudes of all-school meetings lately, including one today, which is the third one this month.

That's the progress so far!
