The ROV is coming along nicely! A few minor glitches were holding it back, like Amazon Prime not delivering the Magic Lube for the o-rings on time, but other than that it is going well.

The tether is also having problems, as there was a break in it, which was fixed on last Friday. A few other gaps in the insulation are set to be fixed today.
The tether team also contructed another spool to put the tether while inspecting it.

Some pictures are due to appear on the main website, and this blog very soon.

You can always look at all of the source code for the [blog](https://github.com/nparov/blog/) and [the main website](https://github.com/nparov/nparov.github.io) on GitHub.
